    READ THIS FIRST BEFORE MAKING ANY EDITS BELOW!

    This Docsify documentation uses a custom-made html style to be able to format completely
    different types of lists.
    This system is implemented so that this guide can be written in legislation-style format.

    When to use heading formats and which:

# Text                                  - Heading 1: Used for the title in the documentation
## Text                                 - Heading 2: Used for "Parts" (e.g. Part I. Preliminary)
### Text                                - Heading 3: Used for section titles.

    For longer sections, you may split them into subsections with a level 1 indented list.

1. Level 1 indented list                - Subsection
                                          (uses a list format in (1), (2), (3) ...)
    1. Level 2 indented list            - Used for paragraphs
                                          (will print out lists in (a), (b), (c) ... )
        1. Level 3 indented list        - Used for subparagraphs
                                          (prints out lists in lowercase roman numerals)
            1. Level 4 indented list    - Used for sub-subparagraphs
                                          (similar to paragraphs but uses uppercase letters)

    For interpretation (or "definitions") sections that has more than one word to be defined:

<div class="interpretation-list">

+ **"word"** means ...

</div>

    While it seems unconventional, the <div> wrappers are necessary so it knows that
    it is an interpretation list (currently looking for a way that doesnt require div wrappers).
    Ensure that the word being defined is in bold as well.
