# Conflict Resolution

## Preliminary

### Preamble

Conflict (often referred to as **"drama"**) is a natural part of any community, especially in online spaces where the other party's message can be misunderstood and disagreements can escalate quickly. It can happen anywhere and anytime.

### Principles

When it comes to conflict resolution, the goal is not to "win" but to restore respect, understanding, and stability within the community. Conflict resolution doesn't just happen in a blink of an eye. It can take a while and it requires patience, active listening, and a willingness to compromise.

Respect must always come first when resolving conflicts between both parties. It is also important to approach such situations with the belief that most conflicts come from misunderstanding and not of malice.

### Types of Conflict

Various types of conflict can happen within the community.

#### Simple Disagreement
A simple disagreement involves a small differences of opinion or a minor frustration between both parties or more. 

#### Moderate Conflict


#### Severe Conflict
