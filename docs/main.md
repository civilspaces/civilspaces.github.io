## Welcome

*civil**Spaces**.* is a set of flexible, platform-neutral resources made to help you foster a more civil discussion in online community spaces.

These resources are designed with all kinds of communities in mind: from Discord servers, Reddit communities, to social forums and gaming guilds.

In this page, you will find:
- a **[Community Standards Guide](standards.md "Community Standards Guide")** which is a ruleset that outlines expectations for civil, respectful, and constructive participation across all community spaces; and
- a **[Moderation & Enforcement Playbook](enforcement.md "Moderation & Enforcement Playbook")** that helps moderators and communities define proper standards for moderation.

These resources are updated periodically to include more useful information.

### Why?

In the online world, there are millions of discussions going on in various community spaces.

Healthy communities thrive when members feel respected, heard, and safe. These guidelines aim to balance free expression with constructive boundaries so discussions can stay productive and inclusive.

### Things to note

These resources are merely a foundation; they are by no means exhaustive and complete. In the end, you have the power to set your own standards in your own community spaces, and define what are the things that are acceptable and otherwise for you.

You may use these resources as-is, or you can adapt them to fit your own community's culture and needs.

### Credits

*civil**Spaces**.* is inspired from a similar guide that was written in the past (which was really helpful and informative), though it was more oriented towards Discord servers. When we tried to look for it again, the website was unfortunately no longer there. We made these resources as a tribute to that very guide.
